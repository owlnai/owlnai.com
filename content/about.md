I'm a Full Stack Developer at MRM based in Spain.

As a teenager, I built simple websites using HTML in Notepad. My love for wikis and sharing knowledge naturally led me to web development, where I discovered that code could make pages come alive.

After diving deep into UI design, inspired by a creative friend who passed away, I learned that great design should be recognizable and timeless. Most importantly, it should be accessible and serve as a bridge between user needs and the system.

These days, I do a little bit of everything. At MRM, I work for some of the world's most recognizable brands. I also do freelance work and create content, always believing that everyone should be kind and give back to the community.
